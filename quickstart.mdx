## Prerequisites

Before you start, make sure you have:

- **Claude Code** installed on your computer ([download here](https://claude.ai/download))
- **Node.js 18+** installed ([nodejs.org](https://nodejs.org))
- An active **Claude subscription** (Pro or Max plan)

## Step 1: Install the Bridge

The Bridge is a small program that runs on your computer and connects it to the Coder1 IDE in your browser.

<Tabs>
  <Tab title="Quick Install (Recommended)">
    Open your terminal and run:
    ```bash
    curl -sL https://coder1.ai/install-bridge.sh | bash
    ```
    This downloads and installs the `coder1-bridge` command. No sudo required.
  </Tab>
  <Tab title="Manual Install">
    If you prefer to review the code first:
    ```bash
    git clone https://github.com/MichaelrKraft/coder1-ide.git
    cd coder1-ide/bridge-cli
    npm install
    npm link
    ```
  </Tab>
</Tabs>

Verify the install worked:
```bash
coder1-bridge --version
```

## Step 2: Open the IDE

Go to **[coder1.ai/ide](https://coder1.ai/ide)** in your browser.

## Step 3: Connect the Bridge

<Steps>
  <Step title="Click the Bridge button">
    Click the **Bridge** button (cyan, top right of the IDE). You'll see a 6-digit pairing code like `823456`.
  </Step>
  <Step title="Start the bridge locally">
    In your **local terminal** (not the web terminal), run:
    ```bash
    coder1-bridge start
    ```
  </Step>
  <Step title="Enter the pairing code">
    When prompted, enter the 6-digit code from the IDE. The code expires after 5 minutes.
  </Step>
  <Step title="Watch for confirmation">
    You'll see:
    ```
    ✅ Connected successfully!
    🚀 Bridge is active
    ```
    The Bridge button in the IDE will turn green.
  </Step>
</Steps>

## Step 4: Test It

In the **web terminal** (inside the IDE), type:

```bash
claude "Hello! Can you hear me?"
```

Claude should respond. You're connected!

<Tip>
  The bridge runs on YOUR computer. Close the terminal tab and the connection drops. To reconnect, just run `coder1-bridge start` again.
