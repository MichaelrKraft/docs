## The Security Model

Coder1 is built on a **local-first security** principle: your code never leaves your computer. The Bridge acts as a secure relay — it forwards commands and responses, but never stores them.

```
What we CAN see:              What we CANNOT see:
✅ "User sent a command"      ❌ Your actual code
✅ "Command completed"        ❌ Your file contents
✅ Connection timing          ❌ Command contents
✅ Bridge version             ❌ Your directory structure
```

## What Travels Over the Connection

**Travels (encrypted):**
- Commands you type in the IDE
- Output from those commands
- Connection handshakes and heartbeats

**Stays local (never sent):**
- Your source files (`.js`, `.py`, `.ts`, etc.)
- Your environment variables
- Your Claude API key
- Your SSH keys, passwords, secrets

## Encryption

All communication uses **WSS (WebSocket Secure) over TLS 1.3** — the same encryption used by online banking.

| Layer | Protocol | What It Does |
|-------|----------|--------------|
| Transport | TLS 1.3 | Encrypts all data in transit |
| WebSocket | WSS | Persistent encrypted channel |
| Authentication | JWT + pairing codes | Proves you authorized the connection |

## Authentication Flow

Connecting the Bridge requires two factors: the pairing code (generated in your browser session) and the Bridge client running on your machine.

```
1. You click "Bridge" in the IDE → server generates 6-digit code
2. Code is single-use and expires in 5 minutes
3. You enter the code in your local terminal
4. Server validates code, issues a session JWT
5. All subsequent commands use the JWT — no more codes needed
```

**Stolen code scenario:** An attacker who intercepts your pairing code still can't connect — they'd also need access to your browser session AND have the Bridge running on your computer. Residual risk: LOW.

## Pairing Code Security

| Property | Value |
|----------|-------|
| Length | 6 digits (1,000,000 possibilities) |
| Expiry | 5 minutes |
| Reuse | Single-use only |
| Binding | Tied to your browser session |
| Rate limit | Max 5 code generations per minute |

## Least Privilege

The Bridge runs under **your user account** — not root. It inherits your shell permissions, so it can only do what you could do yourself in a terminal. No elevated privileges are requested or required.

## Open Source

The Bridge client is open source and fully auditable:

```bash
# Review the code before installing
git clone https://github.com/MichaelrKraft/coder1-ide.git
cd coder1-ide/bridge-cli
# Read the source, then install:
npm install && npm link
```

## Privacy & Data Retention

| Data | Collected | Retention |
|------|-----------|-----------|
| Connection timestamps | Yes | 30 days |
| Command count (not content) | Yes | 30 days |
| Crash logs | Yes | 30 days |
| Code content | **Never** | — |
| Command text | **Never** | — |
| File paths | **Never** | — |

### Disable Telemetry

```bash
export CODER1_TELEMETRY=false
coder1-bridge start
```

Add to `~/.zshrc` or `~/.bashrc` to make permanent.

## Reporting Security Issues

Found a vulnerability? Please email us with subject **"SECURITY: [issue]"** before public disclosure. We commit to responding within 48 hours and will credit you in release notes if desired.

**GitHub Issues:** [github.com/MichaelrKraft/coder1-ide/issues](https://github.com/MichaelrKraft/coder1-ide/issues)

<Warning>
  Please don't post security vulnerabilities publicly before giving us a chance to fix them. We take security seriously and move fast on fixes.
</Warning>

## Audit Status

A third-party security audit is planned before General Availability. The Bridge is currently in alpha — code is iterating quickly. Full audit scope: penetration testing, code review, infrastructure assessment, SOC 2 / GDPR compliance.
