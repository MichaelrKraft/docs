## What Is Johnny5?

Johnny5 is Coder1's built-in AI assistant — a conversational Claude-powered assistant that lives in the IDE sidebar. Unlike a standard chat interface, Johnny5 has **persistent memory** across sessions, can **execute autonomous tasks**, and learns your workflows over time.

<Note>
  Johnny5 is accessible from the **Johnny5 tab** in the IDE sidebar. No bridge required — it connects through Coder1's servers using your account.

## Use Cases

### Second Brain

Turn Johnny5 into a personal knowledge system. Text it anything you want to remember — links, ideas, tasks, book notes. Search and browse everything later from the Johnny5 interface.

```
"Remember that I want to read 'The Pragmatic Programmer'"
"Save this link: [URL] — good reference for JWT auth"
"What links have I saved about authentication?"
```

### Morning Brief

Have Johnny5 prepare a personalized daily briefing — top news, content ideas, your task list, and proactive suggestions for what it can handle for you.

```
"Set up a daily morning brief at 8 AM with top AI news,
 3 content ideas for my channel, and my tasks for today"
```

### Goal-Driven Autonomous Tasks

Share your goals with Johnny5, and it will proactively generate and complete tasks that move you toward them — research, drafts, code improvements, competitor analysis.

```
"Here are my goals for this quarter: [goals]
 Every morning, generate 4-5 tasks you can complete for me
 and start working on the highest priority one."
```

### Market Research

Research what people are discussing on Reddit and X about any topic — find pain points, opportunities, and trends.

```
"Research challenges people have with AI coding assistants
 from the last 30 days. Find the top pain points and
 suggest product opportunities."
```

### Content Factory

Set up a multi-agent pipeline: one agent researches trending topics, another writes video scripts, another generates thumbnail concepts. Johnny5 coordinates the workflow and posts results to your preferred channel.

### Mission Control

Replace third-party apps with custom-built tools integrated with Johnny5's memory — a unified calendar, task manager, notes, and metrics dashboard all in one place.

## Getting Started

Start a conversation in the Johnny5 tab:

```
"Hi! I'm Mike. I'm building Coder1 IDE —
 an agentic web IDE for Claude Code users."
```

Johnny5 will remember this context across all future sessions.

**Give it goals:**

```
"My main goals are to grow Coder1's user base,
 ship new features weekly, and create content
 about Claude Code for my YouTube channel."
```

**Ask it to do things:**

```
"Draft a Twitter thread announcing our new Johnny5 memory feature"
"Research our top competitors and summarize their key differentiators"
"Help me plan this week's sprint"
```

## Memory & Privacy

Johnny5 stores memories in your account's private database. Memories are:
- Only visible to you
- Used to personalize every response
- Manageable via `/memory` commands in the chat

```
/memory list          # See all stored memories
/memory delete [id]   # Delete a specific memory
/memory clear         # Clear all memories (use with caution)
```
