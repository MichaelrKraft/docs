## What Is the Bridge?

The Bridge is a lightweight program that runs on your computer and creates a secure tunnel between the Coder1 web IDE and your local Claude Code CLI.

```
┌─────────────────┐         ┌──────────────────┐
│  Coder1 Website │◄──────►│  YOUR Computer   │
│  (In Browser)   │  Bridge │  (Stays Private) │
└─────────────────┘         └──────────────────┘
     You type                   Commands run
     commands here              here locally
```

**Your code never leaves your machine.** Only commands and their output travel over the encrypted connection.

## Installation

### Option A: One-Line Install

```bash
curl -sL https://coder1.ai/install-bridge.sh | bash
```

This script:
1. Checks for Node.js (won't proceed if missing)
2. Downloads the Bridge CLI
3. Makes `coder1-bridge` available in your terminal
4. Creates `~/.coder1/` config directory

No `sudo` required — everything installs in your user directory.

### Option B: Install from Source

For security-conscious users who want to review the code first:

```bash
# Download and review the installer
curl -sL https://coder1.ai/install-bridge.sh > install.sh
cat install.sh
bash install.sh

# OR clone from GitHub directly
git clone https://github.com/MichaelrKraft/coder1-ide.git
cd coder1-ide/bridge-cli
npm install && npm link
```

### Verify Installation

```bash
coder1-bridge --version
# Expected: coder1-bridge/1.x.x
```

## Connecting to the IDE

<Steps>
  <Step title="Open Coder1 IDE">
    Go to [coder1.ai/ide](https://coder1.ai/ide). Click the **Bridge** button (cyan, top right) to get your pairing code.
  </Step>
  <Step title="Open YOUR local terminal">
    **Not the web terminal** — open the Terminal app on your computer:
    - **Mac:** Cmd+Space → type "Terminal"
    - **Windows:** Win+R → type "cmd"
    - **Linux:** Ctrl+Alt+T
  </Step>
  <Step title="Start the bridge">
    ```bash
    coder1-bridge start
    ```
    You'll see a prompt for the pairing code.
  </Step>
  <Step title="Enter the pairing code">
    Type the 6-digit code shown in the IDE. Codes expire after **5 minutes** and are single-use.
  </Step>
  <Step title="Confirm connection">
    ```
    ✅ Connected successfully!
    🚀 Bridge is active - you can now use Claude commands in the IDE
    ```
  </Step>
</Steps>

## Using the Bridge

Once connected, commands you type in the web terminal run on your machine:

```bash
# Ask Claude for help
claude "How do I center a div in CSS?"

# Generate code
claude "Create a React button component with hover effects"

# Debug code
claude "Why is this function not working?" --file ./my-file.js
```

## Disconnecting

Press **Ctrl+C** in the terminal where `coder1-bridge start` is running. Your computer is immediately disconnected.

## Troubleshooting

<AccordionGroup>
  <Accordion title="'Command not found: coder1-bridge'">
    The installer may not have added it to your PATH. Try:
    ```bash
    npm install -g coder1-bridge
    # Or add to PATH:
    export PATH="$PATH:~/.npm-global/bin"
    ```
  </Accordion>
  <Accordion title="'Invalid pairing code'">
    Codes expire after 5 minutes. Click the **Bridge** button in the IDE to generate a fresh code.
  </Accordion>
  <Accordion title="'Connection failed'">
    1. Check your internet connection
    2. Verify you can reach coder1.ai
    3. Restart: Ctrl+C, then `coder1-bridge start` again
  </Accordion>
  <Accordion title="'Claude Code not found'">
    Install Claude Code first: [claude.ai/download](https://claude.ai/download). Then retry.
  </Accordion>
  <Accordion title="Bridge connects but commands time out">
    After a server restart, wait a few seconds and refresh the browser before sending commands. The bridge infrastructure needs a moment to warm up.
  </Accordion>

## Bridge Diagnostics

```bash
coder1-bridge status    # Check connection status
coder1-bridge test      # Test Claude CLI execution
coder1-bridge diagnose  # Full diagnostic report
