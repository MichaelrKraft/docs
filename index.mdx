## Welcome to Coder1

Coder1 is a web-based IDE that connects to your local Claude Code subscription via the Bridge — giving you a full development environment accessible from any browser, without your code ever leaving your machine.

## How It Works

```
Your Browser (Coder1 IDE) ←──── Bridge ────→ Your Computer
      ↑                                            ↓
  You type commands                    Claude Code CLI runs locally
      ↑                                            ↓
  Results displayed ←──────────────────── Response streams back
```

**Key principle:** Coder1 is a remote control for your local Claude — not a cloud AI service. Your files, your subscription, your machine.
